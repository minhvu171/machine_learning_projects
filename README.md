The transformer folder contains an exercise I completed as part of my Deep Learning course. The exercise is about implementing a Transformer-based machine translation that translates from French to English.



The Diabetes Binary Classification Using Machine Learning contains a Jupyter notebook with Python code that designs several Machine Learning models (Logistic Regression and Random Forest) to predict whether a patient is diabetic or not, based on several independent features. Each model is evaluated, and explainable AI techniques are applied to study the importance of each feature to the output of a classifier. This is done as part of the course Decision Support in Healthcare.
